package conversation

/*
Notes on conversations for future ones:

1. Should codify the numbering of responses
2. Could make a script for this. All i enter is dialog and branch numbers, it does the restrict
3. Should make two separate Dialog structs - one for Player one for Character. Without depth, the character only ever has one response

arg, it'd be good to find a way to make loops, for when the player has multiple questions
